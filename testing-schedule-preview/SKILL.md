# Testing the Europe Schedule

## Overview
There are two schedule views to test:
1. **Bun preview** at `http://127.0.0.1:1234/_deploy/` — internal tool with CFP data, session IDs, contact info
2. **Public schedule page** at `/europe/schedule` — public-facing with grid overview and session list

## Bun Preview (Internal)

### Starting the Server
```bash
cd /path/to/aiecode2025
pnpm europe:source:preview
```
This runs `bun run bun-preview.mjs` inside `src/pages/europe/source/`.

If port 1234 is already in use, kill the existing process first:
```bash
fuser -k 1234/tcp
```
Note: `lsof` may not be available; use `fuser` instead.

### Key Files
- `src/pages/europe/source/_deploy/index.html` — the preview HTML
- `src/pages/europe/source/schedule.json` — data source
- `src/pages/europe/source/photos/` — speaker photos

### What to Test
- Hover tooltips show speaker summary near cursor
- Click-to-expand modal shows full details (CFP data, session IDs, contacts)
- Modal close: ESC key, backdrop click, close button
- Tooltip hides when modal opens (no ghost tooltip behind overlay)
- CFP tag colors render in both tooltip and modal

## Public Schedule Page

### Accessing
- Local: `http://localhost:3000/europe/schedule` (requires Next.js dev server)
- Vercel preview: PRs get deployments at `https://aiecode2025-git-{branch}-aieng.vercel.app/europe/schedule`

### Key File
- `src/pages/europe/schedule.tsx` — React component with grid overview, session cards, modal, filters

### Page Structure
1. **Header** with search, semantic search toggle, filters, expand/collapse buttons
2. **Room x Time Overview grid** — day tabs (April 8/9/10), rooms as columns, time slots as rows
3. **Session list** — expandable cards grouped by day

### What to Test
- Grid cells are clickable — clicking opens a centered modal overlay
- Modal shows: type badge, title, time/room/track, speaker photo + name + role + company + social links, full abstract
- Modal close: ESC key, backdrop click, ESC button
- Social links in modal open in new tab without closing modal
- Cross-check: modal content should match expanded SessionCard in list view below
- Day tab switching works in the grid
- Search filters the session list
- Expand All / Collapse All buttons work

### Testing Approach
1. Open the schedule page
2. Switch to April 9 or 10 to see breakout talks in the grid
3. Click a talk cell — verify modal content
4. Test all 3 close mechanisms
5. Search for the same talk title — find it in the list view
6. Expand it and compare content with what the modal showed

## Section Types
- **Keynotes**: Mostly invited speakers, minimal CFP data, INVITED badge
- **Breakout Talks**: Mix of invited/CFP speakers, may have descriptions
- **Expo Sessions**: Company-sponsored, usually in one of three rooms
- **Workshops**: all April 8, someetimes multi-speaker, longer blocks
- **Track Keynotes**: Per-track opening talks

## Devin Secrets Needed
No secrets needed — both the Bun preview and public schedule are unauthenticated.
