# New Mac Setup

This skill generates and runs a complete, idempotent Mac setup for fullstack web development and AI engineering. It produces 8 shell scripts that can be run individually or via a master runner, plus dotfiles and macOS preference automation.

The scripts are designed to be re-runnable — they check whether each tool is already installed before attempting installation, so you can safely run them again if something fails partway through.

## Philosophy

The setup is opinionated. The core opinions:

- **Terminal**: Ghostty (fast, GPU-accelerated, Zig) + cmux (vertical tabs, split panes, socket API for AI agents). cmux reads Ghostty's config, so one config file serves both.
- **Shell**: ZSH with Oh-My-ZSH, powerlevel10k theme, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting
- **Node**: fnm (not nvm — fnm is faster), pnpm and bun for package management/runtime
- **Python**: uv from Astral (not pyenv, not pip, not conda — uv is dramatically faster and handles both venvs and package installs)
- **Docker**: Colima (not Docker Desktop — lighter weight, CLI-native, free)
- **Editor**: Cursor (AI-native editor)
- **AI tools**: Claude Code, Codex CLI, Antigravity CLI (`agy` via the `antigravity` Homebrew cask), Railway CLI, Ollama for local models
- **Agent notifications**: peon-ping shared across Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor, tuned to notify only when useful
- **Browser**: Dia (from The Browser Company, successor to Arc)
- **Launcher**: Raycast (replaces Alfred, Spotlight, Caffeine, window management)
- **Voice**: Wispr Flow for voice-to-text
- **Screenshots**: Shottr (includes OCR) by default; also recommend [Screendrop](https://github.com/fayazara/Screendrop) for local-first screenshot/screen recording, annotation, capture history, and optional Cloudflare-backed sharing.

## How to Use This Skill

### Step 1: Interview the User

Before generating scripts, ask the user a few questions to customize the setup. Key things to learn:

1. **Git identity**: name and email for `git config`
2. **Hardware**: Which Mac model / how much RAM? (affects which Ollama models to pull)
3. **What to skip**: Do they want everything, or should certain categories be excluded? (e.g., "no Elixir", "no PostgreSQL", "I use Docker Desktop not Colima")
4. **Additions**: Any apps or tools not in the default list?
5. **Terminal preference**: Ghostty + cmux is the default, but they may want something else

For RAM-based Ollama model recommendations:
- **8GB**: qwen3.5:4b, qwen2.5-coder:3b
- **16GB**: qwen3.5:9b, qwen2.5-coder:7b
- **24GB**: qwen3.5:27b, qwen2.5-coder:14b (best sweet spot)
- **32GB+**: qwen3.5:35b, qwen2.5-coder:32b

### Step 2: Generate the Scripts

Generate 8 scripts into the user's chosen directory. Each script is standalone and idempotent. Use the templates in `scripts/` as the base, customizing per the user's answers.

The scripts should run in this order:

```
01-xcode-and-homebrew.sh   # Xcode CLI tools + Homebrew (15-25 min)
02-shell-setup.sh          # Oh-My-ZSH + plugins + fonts
03-brew-packages.sh        # All brew formulae + cask apps
04-dev-environment.sh      # Node (fnm), Python (uv), Git, Docker
05-ai-tools.sh             # Claude Code, Codex CLI, Antigravity CLI, Ollama models, llama.cpp
06-dotfiles.sh             # .zshrc + Ghostty config
07-macos-settings.sh       # System preferences via defaults commands
00-run-all.sh              # Master runner (runs 01-07 in order)
```

### Step 3: Execute

If possible, execute the scripts directly. If running in a VM/sandbox that can't reach the user's Mac, write the scripts to the workspace folder and put a one-liner in the clipboard:

```bash
cd /path/to/scripts && chmod +x ./*.sh && bash ./00-run-all.sh
```

## Lessons Learned (Bugs to Avoid)

These are real issues encountered during testing. The scripts in `scripts/` already incorporate these fixes, but if you're generating fresh scripts, keep these in mind:

1. **fnm needs sourcing before npm works.** After installing Node via fnm, the current shell doesn't have `npm` in PATH until you run `eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd)"`. Every script that uses npm/node must source fnm first.

2. **Don't use `set -e` in the master runner.** If one script fails (e.g., a brew cask 404s), `set -e` kills the entire pipeline. Individual scripts can use `set -e` if they handle errors gracefully, but the master runner should not.

3. **Source brew and fnm in the master runner.** Add these lines near the top of `00-run-all.sh` so all child scripts inherit them:
   ```bash
   eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)" 2>/dev/null || true
   eval "$(fnm env --use-on-cd)" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

4. **Smart quotes break shell commands.** If writing commands to the clipboard, avoid curly/smart quotes. Use simple ASCII quotes only, or avoid quotes entirely where possible. The safest clipboard commands are single simple statements like `bash ./07-macos-settings.sh`.

5. **Zoom and some casks require sudo.** The Zoom installer triggers a `Password:` prompt. The user needs to be warned that some cask installs will pause for their password.

6. **brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies** is needed if Node is managed by fnm (not brew). Otherwise brew tries to install its own Node as a yarn dependency.

7. **Ghostty config location**: `~/.config/ghostty/config`. cmux reads this same file.

## Default Package Lists

### Homebrew Formulae (CLI tools)

```
# Core dev tools
gh, git, fnm, pnpm, bun, z, diff-so-fancy

# Languages & runtimes
elixir, erlang, python@3.13

# Docker (no Docker Desktop)
colima, docker, docker-completion

# Media & processing
ffmpeg, yt-dlp, tesseract

# Build dependencies
openssl@3, readline, sqlite, xz, zstd

# Databases
postgresql@14, rabbitmq

# Misc CLI
honcho, pipx, flyctl, entr, tig, mas, terminal-notifier, googleworkspace-cli

# Google Workspace
googleworkspace-cli installs the `gws` binary; auth still requires `gws auth setup` and `gws auth login`.

# Libraries
cairo, glib, harfbuzz, libvmaf, webp
```

### Homebrew Casks (GUI apps)

```
# Terminal
ghostty

# Editors
cursor, visual-studio-code

# Browser
thebrowsercompany-dia

# Communication
slack, discord, zoom

# Productivity
raycast, rectangle, obsidian, notion, notion-calendar

# AI & ML
ollama, antigravity

# Media
vlc, audacity, tella, descript

# Utilities
shottr, notunes, caffeine, stretchly, quickshade, pure-paste, 1password

# Dev tools
beeper, superhuman, gcloud-cli
```

Plus cmux via: `brew tap manaflow-ai/cmux && brew install --cask cmux`

`gcloud-cli` installs Google Cloud CLI (`gcloud`). Keep `/opt/homebrew/share/google-cloud-sdk/bin` on PATH so additional SDK components are available after install.

## Claude-Suggested Additions (March 2026)

These tools were suggested by Claude during the initial setup session and accepted by the user. They are now part of the default install in `03-brew-packages.sh`:

1. **fzf** — Fuzzy finder that transforms shell history (Ctrl+R), file search, and git branch selection. Pairs perfectly with zsh-autosuggestions. `brew install fzf`
2. **ripgrep** (`rg`) — Blazingly fast grep replacement. Respects .gitignore, searches recursively by default. Essential for any developer. `brew install ripgrep`
3. **bat** — `cat` with syntax highlighting, line numbers, and git integration. Makes reading code files in terminal beautiful. `brew install bat`
4. **zoxide** — Drop-in `z` replacement with a smarter frecency algorithm and fuzzy matching. Same muscle memory, better results. `brew install zoxide`
5. **Orbstack** — Even lighter than Colima for Docker containers and Linux VMs. Has a nice GUI and near-instant startup. `brew install --cask orbstack`

### Global npm Packages

```
undollar, npm-check-updates, trash-cli,
@anthropic-ai/claude-code, @openai/codex, @railway/cli
```

### Antigravity CLI

Install Google Antigravity through Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask antigravity
```

The cask installs the desktop app and exposes `agy` as the Antigravity CLI. Prefer this over Gemini CLI for new setups: Google announced on May 19, 2026 that consumer Gemini CLI access for free, Google AI Pro, and Ultra users stops serving requests on June 18, 2026. Enterprise and paid API-key Gemini CLI access can remain available, but this new-Mac path should default to Antigravity CLI.

### peon-ping Defaults

When setting up AI tools on a new Mac, also install and configure `peon-ping` with these defaults:

- Install globally with the shared runtime under `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/` so Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor can all use the same install.
- Register Claude Code hooks normally via the installer.
- Register Codex manually in `~/.codex/config.toml`:
  ```toml
  notify = ["bash", "/Users/$USER/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/adapters/codex.sh"]
  ```
- Keep Cursor hooked up if `~/.cursor/` exists.
- Use `default_pack: "peon"` as the fallback pack.
- Install this rotation pool:
  `glados`, `jarvis`, `r2d2`, `peasant`, `sc_kerrigan`, `sc_scv`, `sc_marine`, `sc_raynor`, `sc_ghost`, `sc_terran`, `protoss`, `sc2_alarak`, `sc2_abathur`, `ra2_eva_commander`, `ra2_kirov`, `ra2_yuri`, `ra_soviet`, `ccg_gla_worker`, `ccg_us_dozer`, `ccg_china_dozer`
- Set `pack_rotation_mode` to `round-robin`.
- Set `volume` to `0.2`.
- Keep `desktop_notifications` enabled, but use `notification_style: "standard"` rather than large overlays.
- Install `terminal-notifier` via Homebrew so standard macOS notifications work reliably and support click-to-focus behavior.
- Set `suppress_sound_when_tab_focused: true`.
- Set `silent_window_seconds: 30` so `task.complete` only fires for longer-running work.
- Categories:
  - `session.start: false`
  - `task.acknowledge: false`
  - `task.complete: true`
  - `task.error: true`
  - `input.required: true`
  - `resource.limit: true`
  - `user.spam: false`
- Goal: alerts only for meaningful attention events, with completion sounds reserved for work that took long enough to matter.

### Ollama Models (for 24GB RAM)

```
qwen3.5:27b                    # General purpose (256K context, multimodal)
qwen2.5-coder:14b              # Code-focused
deepseek-r1:8b                 # Reasoning
```

### macOS Defaults (automated)

```bash
# Finder: show extensions, show dotfiles, show path bar, list view
# Dock: auto-hide, no recents, no delay, minimize to app icon
# Keyboard: no autocorrect, no smart quotes, fast repeat, no press-and-hold
# Trackpad: no natural scrolling, tap to click
# Screenshots: PNG, Desktop, no shadow
# Menu bar: auto-hide
```

### macOS Settings (manual — guide the user)

These can't be automated via `defaults write`:
1. Spotlight: disable all except Apps + System Settings
2. Siri: disable
3. Screenshot shortcut: remap to Cmd+E
4. Cmd+Q: remap to double-tap (prevent accidental quits)
5. Trackpad: disable dictionary lookup
6. Finder: set new windows to ~/Work
7. Dock: remove all icons except Finder and Trash
8. Cursor size: set to large in Accessibility (good for presentations)

## Apps to Download Manually

These aren't in Homebrew or need manual install:
- [Wispr Flow](https://wispr.com) — voice-to-text (2025 pick)
- [SuperWhisper](https://superwhisper.com) — voice-to-text (2024 pick, still good)
- [Screendrop](https://github.com/fayazara/Screendrop) — local-first screenshots, screen recordings, annotation, capture history, and optional Cloudflare-backed sharing; recommended alongside Shottr
- [Screenflow 11](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) — screen recording
- [Tella.tv](https://www.tella.tv/) — screen recording; preferred replacement for Loom
- [App Quitter](https://appquitter.com) — close apps when windows close
- [Clipbook](https://clipbook.app) or Alfred — clipboard manager

## Post-Install: Open Apps That Need Login

After all scripts finish, open these apps to sign in and configure them. The skill should auto-open them for the user:

```bash
# Apps that need login/activation after install
open -a "Slack"
open -a "Discord"
open -a "Raycast"
open -a "Shottr"
open -a "1Password"
open -a "Spotify"
open -a "Zoom"
open -a "Dia"
open -a "GitHub Desktop" 2>/dev/null
open -a "Claude" 2>/dev/null
echo "🔑 Sign into each app above, then continue setup."
```

## Browser Extensions (install in Dia/Chrome)

Essential:
- uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Video Speed Controller (highly recommended)
- Refined GitHub, React Developer Tools, Code Copy
- 1Password / LastPass

Nice to have:
- Morpheon Dark, bypass-paywalls-chrome, Twitter-Links-beta
- enhanced-history, Display Anchors, Octolinker, little-rat, RescueTime

## Suggested Additions

Things worth considering that aren't in the original blog posts but complement this setup well:

1. **mise** (mise.jdx.dev) — universal version manager for Node, Python, Ruby, Go, etc. Could replace fnm + uv for version management (swyx mentioned exploring this)
2. **zoxide** — smarter `z` alternative with fuzzy matching
3. **bat** — `cat` replacement with syntax highlighting
4. **eza** — modern `ls` replacement
5. **fd** — faster `find` alternative
6. **ripgrep** — faster `grep` (rg)
7. **fzf** — fuzzy finder for shell history, files, everything
8. **starship** — cross-shell prompt (alternative to powerlevel10k, works with fish too)
9. **Bartender** or **Ice** — menu bar icon management (declutter)
11. **Hand Mirror** — quick webcam check from menu bar (great before calls)
12. **Tailscale** — mesh VPN for accessing home machines
13. **Orbstack** — another Docker Desktop alternative (even lighter than Colima)
14. **Aerospace** — tiling window manager (if Rectangle isn't enough)

## Dotfiles Reference

The .zshrc should include:
- Oh-My-ZSH with powerlevel10k theme
- Plugins: git, zsh-autosuggestions, zsh-syntax-highlighting, z
- Homebrew, fnm, and uv PATH setup
- z directory jumping source
- Git aliases (gs, gd, gc, gp, gl, gco, gcb)
- npm/pnpm aliases (ni, nr, pi, pr, ncu)
- Python aliases (pip → uv pip, venv → uv venv)
- Docker aliases (dstart → colima start, dstop → colima stop)
- Editor set to Cursor

The Ghostty config should include:
- Font: "Meslo LG M for Powerline" at 14pt
- Theme: dark:GruvboxDark,light:GruvboxLight
- Shell integration: zsh
- Block cursor, no blink
- Global hotkey: Cmd+` for quick terminal
- Clipboard read/write enabled
